            <h3>About Mona Mehra</h3>
            <p>
              Mona defines a Home for easier understanding so that people make
              happier families and are more productive in their workplaces.
              <br />
              Growing up Mona felt the pain of the womenfolk all around who were
              so disrespect as mothers and wives aka homemakers that she decided
              to find the reason why. As a risk management professional she
              found many similarities between a Home and a workplace and started
              integrating them. She is a work home integrator.

              individual development including all facets of living like
              physical, emotional, intellectual, social and spiritual. Mona
              found that Home is the center of our living, yet it is not
              included in the learning arena. She does trainings to include home
              into the learning area for holistic development and for better
              work-home balance.
